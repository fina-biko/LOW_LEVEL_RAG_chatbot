    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "\n",
    "Good thinking üëå you‚Äôve spotted a real design trade-off. Let‚Äôs break it down in layman terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What‚Äôs happening\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a PDF with 1000 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each page is like a (page_number, page_text) tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you loop, you‚Äôll end up with something like:\n",

    "[\n",

    "  (1000, \"This is page 1000 text...\")\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs a list of tuples. It works fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"heavy list\" concern\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python list can handle 1000 items easily. Even 10,000 is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù comes not from the list itself, but from the text content (if each page is very long).\n",
    "\n",
    "But still: storing plain text in memory (like 1000 pages) is usually fine unless your PDF is gigantic (hundreds of MBs).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 3 common ways experts handle it:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Option A: List of tuples (simple & good enough)\n",
    "pages_text = [(i, page.extract_text()) for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages, start=1)]\n",

    "\n",
    "Easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works well if you don‚Äôt mind holding everything in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Option B: Write to disk as you go\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PDF is huge and memory becomes an issue, don‚Äôt keep everything in RAM:\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"book_text.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n",
    "    for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages, start=1):\n",
    "        text = page.extract_text()\n",
    "        f.write(f\"--- Page {i} ---\\n{text}\\n\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Saves page text directly to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very memory-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Option C: Generator (lazy, on-demand)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of making a big list, you can yield page text one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "def extract_pages(reader):\n",
    "    for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages, start=1):\n",
    "        yield (i, page.extract_text())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "for page_number, text in extract_pages(reader):\n",
    "    print(page_number, text[:100])  # preview only\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you don‚Äôt store everything in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You process each page as it comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ If you‚Äôre just experimenting or doing NLP later, Option A (list of tuples) is fine.\n",
    "üëâ If you‚Äôre dealing with very big PDFs, Option B or C is better."
